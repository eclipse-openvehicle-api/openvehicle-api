The following issues need to be solved:
- The proxy and the stub need access to the local core services (local for the exe they are running in), for:
    - Memory allocation / release
    - Interface marshalling

--> In case the component allocates data to return (e.g. strings, vectory, maps), the stub will NOT free this memory,
    but the memory has to be freed by the caller of the "Call" function (e.g. the receiver of the IPC communication).
    This can be identified by the interpretation of a parameter being "indirect" for "ret", "out" and "inout" parameters.
--> In case the component parameters do not fit in 8 bytes, the stub will allocate memory, which needs to be released
    by the caller of the "Call" function (e.g. the receiver of the IPC communication). This can be identified by the
    interpretation of a parameter being "indirect" for "ret", "out" and "inout" parameters.
